        <h2>Remakes and Movies Through Chronus</h2>

        <p>
            Let’s dive deeper into the world of films and remakes. First, you might as a question “How many remakes have
            been made throughout the filmographic history? Is there a difference in the number of films made across the
            decades? How about remakes?” All of these are valid questions. And let me tell you, there is a difference.
            While there are more remakes and more films made each year, the number of original movies are worth
            re-capturing seems to decline. Well, at least you are not tricking yourself by choosing to re-shoot the film
            instead of trying to aimlessly search for worthy new ideas. This is different with remakes and the whole
            dataset: more movies are made - more remakes are produced. Cooking some statistics to see how close our
            power law fits the log-log distributions, we observe that R2 metric for the whole dataset is 0.86 suggesting
            that the fitted power law distribution explains the data well. This is not the case for the remakes and
            originals with only 0.58 and 0.18 respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, we can notice that the mean number of remakes across the cinematic history is much more recent than
            for the whole dataset. Understandably, before you shoot a remake you have to shoot an original.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, ok, we have more remakes. But it is not about quantity but quality of those, mes amis, that we are
            interested in. To start us off, we should constrain our movie to a reasonable time. Compared to the whole
            dataset, there are not so many outliers and there is not a single remake exceeding 200 minutes.

        <h2>People and Their Opinions</h2>

        <p>
            We want your movie to be great. But to know what “great” actually means, we first need to take a look at
            what people’s opinions are on different movies, be it an original movie, a remake or any other. Let’s now
            take a look at the trends in the vote scores.
        </p>

        <p>
            As we would have predicted anyways, vote scores for originals are shifted to the right meaning that movies
            that really resonated with the audience were chosen to be remade. Rather surprisingly, the remakes didn’t
            seem to keep that sparkle and performed similarly to the rest of the movies. Well, something to think about.
        </p>

        <div class="chart-container">
            <iframe src="/assets/plots/vote_averages.html" width="820px" height="620px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            The remakes appeared to generate significant buzz, receiving a higher average number of votes compared to
            the rest of the dataset. Interestingly, the originals maintained a slight edge in average votes over both
            remakes and other films. This trend could suggest that fans of the original movies felt compelled to share
            their opinions on the recreated versions of the beloved films.
        </p>

            <iframe src="/assets/plots/violin_plot.html" width="820px" height="620px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h2>Bombastic Genre Combo</h2>

        <p>
            Now, we’ve thought a lot about data generally and have made up our mind about some technicalities, but what
            about the movie itself? Let’s think holistically for now and consider a possible genre combination between
            the original movie and the remake.
        </p>

        <div class="chart-container">
            <iframe src="/assets/plots/mean_vote_averages_heatmap.html" width="820px" height="620px"
                frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            Uff, some tenners do seem appealing. But despite the success of the combination, we should approach this
            with some skepticism. Specifically, there might be only few votes for those compared to the ones with a
            lower rating. Overall, it is not just about the score, it is also about the wide public reach and the urgent
            need of the viewers to share their opinion. Plus, it is simply fairer when the votes are given by a variety
            of people. This also applies to the case where there are more votes just because there are more movies. To
            account for all that, we average the vote counts across movies and apply logarithm scaling to make the plot
            descriptive. After checking the vote counts we see that for some genre combinations the value is indeed low.
            This coincides with the tenners that we observe, tough luck. Hence, we multiply vote averages by the mean
            logarithm of vote counts to get a better look.
        </p>

            Seems like you can’t really go wrong with Comedy, Mystery and World cinema. Well, for now that seems fair.

        <p>
            Genres are sorted, but what about the emotions we would like to invoke in our viewers?
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though the sentiment labels for whole movie dataset are more or less evenly split, when it comes to
            remakes and originals there seems to be a prevalence of movies with sad or negative plots. Sad stories often
            have a strong emotional core that can resonate deeply with audiences, providing a built-in emotional
            investment and a higher potential for audience engagement. Due to nostalgic factor and emotional depth,
            these movies might have higher commercial appeal to the audience. Nonetheless, looking at the data,
            specifically vote averages, it seems that on average there was only 0.23% higher score for films with
            negative sentiment. There were no remakes that had a drastically different plotline from the originals: all
            of the sentiment labels for originals matched those of remakes. Overall, it is up to us to choose the
            sentiment of the story.

        <h2>Feature Comparison of Movie Originals vs. Their Remakes</h2>

        <p>
            While some remakes breathe new life into beloved classics, others struggle to capture the magic of their
            predecessors. But beyond revenue and critical reviews, how do the key characteristics of remakes differ from
            their originals? Our data-driven investigation seeks to answer this question by examining the underlying
            features that define both versions of a film.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider, for example, the 2017 remake of It compared to the 1990 original miniseries. The remake featured a
            longer runtime, and a significantly larger budget.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our approach to this analysis is systematic and data-driven. By using statistical techniques like
            distribution comparison and hypothesis testing, we seek to quantify how each variable differs between
            originals and remakes.

            Visualizing and Testing Differences: Aggregate Analysis of Originals vs. Remakes
        </h2>

        <p>
            We apply Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to determine if two distributions are significantly different. If the
            p-value is below 0.05, we conclude that the distributions are significantly different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking at the distributions, we observe notable differences between originals and remakes in terms of star
            popularity, vote average, and budget. Specifically, movie remakes generally feature higher star popularity,
            lower vote averages, and larger budgets compared to originals.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, can these differences be solely attributed to whether a movie is an original or a remake? To
            address this question, we will conduct a more in-depth analysis in the following sections.
